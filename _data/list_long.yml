  # Abstract of the paper.
  abstract: Observations from the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems in
    the Tropics (PREDICT), Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP), and
    Intensity Forecast Experiment (IFEX) field campaigns are analyzed to investigate
    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010). Research aircraft missions provided Doppler radar, in situ flight level,
    and dropsonde data documenting the structural changes of the predepression disturbance.
    Following the pre-Karl wave pouch, variational analyses at the meso-β and meso-α
    scales suggest that the convective cycle in Karl alternately built the low- and
    midlevel circulations leading to genesis episodically rather than through a sustained
    lowering of the convective mass flux from increased stabilization. Convective
    bursts that erupt in the vorticity-rich environment of the recirculating pouch
    region enhance the low-level meso-β- and meso-α-scale circulation through vortex
    stretching. As the convection wanes, the resulting stratiform precipitation strengthens
    the midlevel circulation through convergence associated with ice microphysical
    processes, protecting the disturbance from the intrusion of dry environmental
    air. Once the column saturation fraction returns to a critical value, a subsequent
    convective burst below the midlevel circulation further enhances the low-level
    circulation, and the convective cycle repeats. The analyses suggest that the onset
    of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely related to the
    coupling of the vorticity and moisture fields at low and midlevels. Our interpretation
    of the observational analysis presented in this study reaffirms a primary role
    of deep convection in the genesis process and provides a hypothesis for the supporting
    role of stratiform precipitation and the midlevel vortex.

  title: A Comparison of the Polarimetric Radar Characteristics of Heavy Rainfall
    from Hurricanes Harvey (2017) and Florence (2018)

  journal: Journal of Geophysical Research - Atmospheres

  doi: https://doi.org/10.1029/2019JD032212
  keypoint1: Rain drop size distributions in Harvey and Florence were broadly similar
    to other tropical cyclones
  keypoint2: High-concentrations of midsize drops were more common and widespread
    in Harvey than in Florence
  keypoint3: Harvey's rainfall was more intense and asymmetric due to vertical wind
    shear and a weaker intensity
  abstract: Polarimetric coastal radar data are used to compare the rainfall characteristics
    of Hurricanes Harvey (2017) and Florence (2018). Intense rainfall was an infrequent
    yet important contributor to the total rainfall in Harvey, but its relative contribution
    varied spatially. The total rainfall over land maximized near the coast over Beaumont,
    TX due to intense convection resulting from prolonged onshore flow downshear from
    the circulation center. Overall, polarimetric radar observations in Harvey show
    a dominance of high concentrations of small-to-medium drops, consistent with prior
    tropical cyclone studies. The microphysical characteristics were spatially and
    temporally inhomogeneous however, with larger drops more frequent on 27 August
    and higher number concentrations more frequent on 28 and 30 August. The polarimetric
    variables and raindrop characteristics observed during Florence share broad similarities
    to Harvey, but had reduced variability, fewer observations of stronger reflectivity
    and differential reflectivity, and a lower frequency of high number concentrations
    and medium-sized drops. The radar data indicate Florence had reduced coverage
    of stronger convection compared to Harvey. We hypothesize that differences in
    storm motion, intensity decay rates, and vertical wind shear produce the distinct
    precipitation structures and microphysical differences seen in Harvey and Florence.

  # Keypoints of Paper & Abstract
  keypoint1: Anti-cyclonic wave breaking (AWB) activity is shown to be associated
    with the second leading EOF mode in tropical North Atlantic vertical wind shear
    (VWS) and accounts for 23% of the structured variance.
  keypoint2: While the tropical sources of VWS from ENSO and the AMM remain the dominant
    drivers of tropical North Atlantic VWS, the extratropical sources of VWS from
    AWB are an important contribution to tropical and subtropical VWS variability
    and tropical cyclone (TC) activity.
  keypoint3: VWS anomalies induced by AWB activity may be a suitable indicator of
    AWB impacts on VWS and its subsequent influence on seasonal TC activity.
  abstract: Given recent insights into the role of anticyclonic Rossby wave breaking
    (AWB) in driving subseasonal and seasonal North Atlantic tropical cyclone (TC)
    activity, this study further examines tropical versus subtropical impacts on TC
    activity by considering large-scale influences on boreal summer tropical zonal
    vertical wind shear (VWS) variability, a key predictor of seasonal TC activity.
    Through an empirical orthogonal function analysis, it is shown that subtropical
    AWB activity drives the second mode of variability in tropical zonal VWS, while
    El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) primarily drives the leading mode of variability.
    Linear regressions of the four leading principal components against tropical North
    Atlantic zonal VWS and accumulated cyclone energy show that, while the leading
    mode holds much of the regression strength, some improvement can be achieved with
    the addition of the second and third modes. Furthermore, an index of AWB-associated
    VWS anomalies, a proxy for AWB impacts on the large-scale environment, may be
    a better indicator of summertime VWS anomalies. The utilization of this index
    may be used to better understand AWB’s contribution to seasonal TC activity.

  keypoint1: This manuscript examines the relationship between the QBO and the MJO
    during the boreal winter and finds that the strong relationship observed in recent
    years did not exist prior to the mid 1970s.  We hypothesize that climate change
    has strengthened the relationship between the MJO and QBO.
  keypoint2: false
  keypoint3: false
  abstract: A strong relationship between the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) of
    equatorial stratospheric winds and the amplitude of the Madden-Julian oscillation
    (MJO) during the boreal winter has recently been uncovered using observational
    data from the mid-1970s to the present. When the QBO is in its easterly phase
    in the lower stratosphere, it favors stronger MJO activity during boreal winter,
    while the MJO tends to be weaker during the westerly phase of the QBO. Here we
    show using reconstructed indices of the MJO and QBO back to 1905 that the relationship
    between enhanced boreal winter MJO activity and the easterly phase of the QBO
    has only emerged since the early 1980s. The emergence of this relationship coincides
    with the recent cooling trend in the equatorial lower stratosphere and the warming
    trend in the equatorial upper troposphere, which appears to have sensitized MJO
    convective activity to QBO-induced changes in static stability near the tropopause.
    Climate change is thus suggested to have played a role in promoting coupling between
    the MJO and the QBO.

  abstract: This paper summarizes the forecast methods, outputs and skill offered
    by twelve agencies for seasonal tropical cyclone (TC) activity around the world.
    These agencies use a variety of techniques ranging from statistical models to
    dynamical models to predict basinwide activity and regional activity. In addition,
    several dynamical and hybrid statistical/dynamical models now predict TC track
    density as well as landfall likelihood. Realtime Atlantic seasonal hurricane forecasts
    have shown low skill in April, modest skill in June and good skill in August at
    predicting basinwide TC activity when evaluated over 2003-2018. Real-time western
    North Pacific seasonal TC forecasts have shown good skill by July for basinwide
    intense typhoon numbers and the ACE index when evaluated for 2003-2018. Both hindcasts
    and real-time forecasts have shown skill for other TC basins. A summary of recent
    research into forecasting TC activity beyond seasonal (e.g., multi-year) timescales
    is included. Recommendations for future areas of research are also discussed.

  keypoint1: Single Doppler radar retrievals capture the structural evolution of Hurricane
    Michael's polygonal eyewall during rapid intensification. # It can be capsule summary or keypoint
  keypoint2: The propagation speeds of asymmetric winds and reflectivity are consistent
    with linear vortex Rossby wave theory.
  keypoint3: Coastal radar observations and the generalized velocity track display
    technique can help to improve tropical cyclone intensity forecasts.
  abstract: Hurricane Matthew (2016) was observed by the NEXRAD KAMX polarimetric
    radar and NOAA P-3 airborne radar near the coast of the southeastern United States
    for several hours, providing a novel opportunity to evaluate and compare single
    and multiple Doppler wind retrieval techniques for tropical cyclone flows. The
    generalized velocity track display (GVTD) technique can retrieve a subset of the
    wind field from a single ground-based Doppler radar under the assumption of nearly
    axisymmetric rotational wind, but is shown to have errors from aliasing of unresolved
    wind components. An improved technique that mitigates errors due to storm motion
    is derived in this study, although some spatial aliasing remains due to limited
    information content from the single Doppler measurements. A spline-based variational
    wind retrieval technique called SAMURAI can retrieve the full three-dimensional
    wind field from airborne radar fore-aft pseudo-dual Doppler scanning, but is shown
    to have errors due to temporal aliasing from the non-simultaneous Doppler measurements.
    A comparison between the two techniques shows that the axisymmetric tangential
    winds are generally comparable between the two techniques after the improvements
    to GVTD retrievals. Fourier decomposition of asymmetric kinematic and convective
    structure shows more discrepancies due to spatial and temporal aliasing in the
    retrievals. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique for studying tropical
    cyclone structure are discussed, and suggest that complementary information can
    be retrieved from both single and multiple Doppler retrievals. Future improvements
    to the asymmetric flow assumptions in single Doppler analysis and steady-state
    assumptions in pseudo-dual Doppler analysis are required to reconcile differences
    in retrieved tropical cyclone structure.
  summary: Polygonal eyewall asymmetries of Hurricane Michael (2018) during rapid
    intensification (RI) are analyzed from ground-based single Doppler radar. Here
    we present the first observational evidence of the evolving wind field of a polygonal
    eyewall during RI to Category 5 intensity by deducing the axisymmetric and asymmetric
    winds at 5-minute intervals. Spectral time decomposition of the retrieved tangential
    wind structure shows quantitative evidence of high-order azimuthal wavenumbers
    with propagation speeds that are consistent with linear wave theory on a radial
    vorticity gradient, suggesting the presence of rapidly-evolving vortex Rossby
    waves. Dual-Doppler winds from the airborne NOAA P-3 Hurricane Hunter provide
    further evidence of the three-dimensional vortex structure that supports growth
    of asymmetries during RI. Both reflectivity and tangential wind fields show polygonal
    structure and propagate at similar speeds, suggesting a close coupling of the
    dynamics and the convective organization during the intensification.

  abstract: Observations from the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems in
    the Tropics (PREDICT), Genesis and Rapid Intensification Processes (GRIP), and
    Intensity Forecast Experiment (IFEX) field campaigns are analyzed to investigate
    the mesoscale processes leading to the tropical cyclogenesis of Hurricane Karl
    (2010). Research aircraft missions provided Doppler radar, in situ flight level,
    and dropsonde data documenting the structural changes of the predepression disturbance.
    Following the pre-Karl wave pouch, variational analyses at the meso-β and meso-α
    scales suggest that the convective cycle in Karl alternately built the low- and
    midlevel circulations leading to genesis episodically rather than through a sustained
    lowering of the convective mass flux from increased stabilization. Convective
    bursts that erupt in the vorticity-rich environment of the recirculating pouch
    region enhance the low-level meso-β- and meso-α-scale circulation through vortex
    stretching. As the convection wanes, the resulting stratiform precipitation strengthens
    the midlevel circulation through convergence associated with ice microphysical
    processes, protecting the disturbance from the intrusion of dry environmental
    air. Once the column saturation fraction returns to a critical value, a subsequent
    convective burst below the midlevel circulation further enhances the low-level
    circulation, and the convective cycle repeats. The analyses suggest that the onset
    of deep convection and associated low-level spinup were closely related to the
    coupling of the vorticity and moisture fields at low and midlevels. Our interpretation
    of the observational analysis presented in this study reaffirms a primary role
    of deep convection in the genesis process and provides a hypothesis for the supporting
    role of stratiform precipitation and the midlevel vortex.

  keypoint1: This study examines the interactions of a pre-depression Hagupit with
    vertical wind shear (VWS) at various spatial scales from synoptic to meso-scales
    using field observations.
  keypoint2: We highlight the persistent convection maintaining moisture and vorticity
    inside the wave pouch even under 20 m/s deep-layer VWS.

    insight for the supporting role of low-level VWS providing horizontal vorticity
    and organizing convection in the early stage of tropical cyclogenesis.
  abstract: >
    The impact of vertical wind shear (VWS) on cyclogenesis is examined from the synoptic
    to meso scales using airborne Doppler radar observations of pre-depression Hagupit
    during Tropical Cyclone Structure 2008 (TCS08) / THORPEX Pacific Area Regional
    Campaign (T-PARC) field campaigns. The high temporal and spatial resolution observations
    reveal complex localized convective and vortical characteristics of a pre-depression
    in a sheared environment. Pre-depression Hagupit interacted with an upper-tropospheric
    trough during the observation period. The strong deep-layer VWS (> 20 m s -1)
    had a negative impact on the development through misalignment of the low and mid-level
    circulations and dry air intrusion. However, the low-level circulation persisted
    and the system ultimately formed into a tropical cyclone after it left the high-shear
    zone. Here we propose that a key process that enabled the predepression to survive
    through the upper-tropospheric trough interaction was persistent vorticity amplification
    on the meso-gamma scale that was aggregated on the mesoalpha scale within the
    pouch. Multi-Doppler wind analysis indicates that cumulus congestus tilted the
    low-level horizontal vorticity into the vertical in the early stage of convective
    life-cycle, followed by stretching from maturing deep convection. Variations in
    low-level VWS on the meso-beta scale affect convective organization and horizontal
    vorticity generation. The results provide new insights into multi-scale processes
    during TC genesis and the interactions of a pre-depression with VWS at various
    spatial scales.

  title: Quantifying the Probability and Causes of the Surprisingly Active 2018 North
    Atlantic hurricane season

  keypoint1: The 2018 North Atlantic hurricane season witnessed activity 25% above
    the long-term average, due mainly to high activity in the subtropics
  keypoint2: The environmental fields that explain most variance in long-term hurricane
    activity all predicted a below-normal 2018 hurricane season
  keypoint3: The 2018 hurricane season highlights the need for seasonal hurricane
    outlooks to be issued in terms of probability of exceedance
  abstract: The 2018 North Atlantic hurricane season was a destructive season with
    hurricanes Florence and Michael causing significant damage in the southeastern
    United States. In keeping with most destructive hurricane seasons, basinwide tropical
    cyclone activity was above average in 2018?by ~25% for named storm numbers, hurricane
    numbers, and Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE). In contrast to this above-normal
    activity, the August?September tropical environmental fields that explain ~50%
    of the variance in Atlantic basin hurricane activity between 1950 and 2017 anticipated
    a well below-average 2018 hurricane season. The surprisingly large mismatch between
    the observed and replicated levels of hurricane activity in 2018 is an extreme
    example of the uncertainty inherent in seasonal hurricane outlooks and highlights
    the need for these outlooks to be issued in terms of probability of exceedance.
    Such probabilistic information would better clarify the uncertainty associated
    with hurricane outlooks to the benefit of users. With retrospective knowledge
    of the August?September 2018 key tropical environmental fields, the chance that
    the observed 2018 Atlantic hurricane activity would occur is about 5%. The reasons
    for the surprisingly high hurricane activity in 2018 are a hurricane outbreak
    in early September and, in particular, the occurrence of unusually high tropical
    cyclone activity in the subtropical North Atlantic. The hyperactive subtropical
    activity was not anticipated because contemporary statistical models of seasonal
    Atlantic hurricane activity lack skill in anticipating subtropical ACE compared
    to tropical ACE.
  summary: Seasonal outlooks for North Atlantic hurricane activity contribute to the
    anticipation of risk for insurance companies, other weather-sensitive businesses,
    and local and national governments. However, the uncertainty associated with such
    forecasts is often unclear. This reduces their benefit and contributes to the
    perception of forecast “busts.” The issue is highlighted by the destructive and
    surprising 25% above-average 2018 Atlantic hurricane season. Retrospective examination
    of the key August–September 2018 environmental fields that explain ~50% of long‐term
    Atlantic hurricane activity shows that all were consistent with a well below‐average
    2018 hurricane season. A below‐normal season was also anticipated by hurricane
    outlooks issued in early August 2018. The large mismatch between the observed
    and replicated levels of hurricane activity in 2018 is an extreme example of the
    uncertainty inherent in hurricane outlooks. We show that this uncertainty may
    be properly clarified by expressing outlooks in terms of probability of exceedance.
    The likelihood that the observed 2018 hurricane activity would occur with retrospective
    knowledge of the key environmental fields is about 5%. Hyperactive storm activity
    in the subtropical North Atlantic contributed to the surprisingly active 2018
    hurricane season. The unusual subtropical activity was not anticipated because
    statistical models lack skill in anticipating such activity.

  title: A Statistical Seasonal Forecast Model of North Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclones
    using the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation

  keypoint1: This manuscript proposes using the QBO to model cyclone tracks over the
    North Indian Ocean
  keypoint2: More North Indian Ocean TCs were found to form when the QBO was in its
    east phase than when the QBO was in its west phase, and these TCs were more likely
    to track westward and northwestward.
  keypoint3: Alternatively, when the QBO was in its west phase, TCs were more likely
    to track northward and northeastward.
  abstract: Previous studies have shown that the skill of seasonal forecasts of tropical
    cyclone (TC) activity over the North Indian Ocean (NIO) tends to be poor. This
    paper investigates the forecast potential of TC formation, trajectories and points
    of landfall in the NIO region using an index of the stratospheric quasi-biennial
    oscillation (QBO) as the predictor variable in a new statistical seasonal forecast
    model. Genesis was modelled by kernel density estimation, tracks were fitted using
    a generalized additive model (GAM) approach with an Euler integration step, and
    landfall location was estimated using a country mask. The model was trained on
    30 years of TC observations (1980–2009) from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center
    and the QBO index at lags from 0 to 6 months. Over this time period, and within
    each season and QBO phase, the kernel density estimator modelled the distribution
    of genesis points, and the cyclone trajectories were then fit by the GAM along
    the observed cyclone tracks as smooth functions of location. Trajectories were
    simulated from randomly selected genesis points in the kernel density estimates.
    Ensembles of cyclone paths were traced, taking account of random innovations every
    6-hr along the GAM-fitted velocity fields, to determine the points of landfall.
    Lead–lag analysis was used to assess the best predictor timescales for TC forecast
    potential. We found that the best model utilized the QBO index with a 3-month
    lead. Two hindcast validation methods were applied. First, leave-one-out cross-validation
    was performed where the country of landfall was decided by the majority vote of
    the simulated tracks. Second, the distances between the landfall locations in
    the observations and simulations were calculated. Application of seasonal forecast
    analysis further indicated that including information on the state of the QBO
    has the potential to improve the skill of TC seasonal forecasts in the NIO region.

  keypoint1: This manuscript investigated the roles of several different atmospheric
    wave types on western North Pacific TC formation
  keypoint2: Nearly 80% of western North Pacific TCs were a result of two or more
    different wave types
  keypoint3: When the convectively-enhanced phases of the MJO and equatorial Rossby
    waves were present, synoptic-scale waves tended to be stronger and more organized,
    enhancing TC formation likelihood
  abstract: The tropical cyclone (TC)-centric approach developed in previous studies
    tends to overemphasize the direct impact of tropical waves and underestimates
    their large-scale modulation of western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclogenesis
    (TCG). To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new approach based
    on empirical orthogonal function analyses to re-examine associations of multiple
    waves, including the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), quasi-biweekly oscillation
    (QBWO), convective equatorial Rossby (ER) waves, and synoptic scale waves (SSWs),
    with WNP TCG events. There is a close association between WNP TCG events (total
    of 273 TCs in this study) and SSWs (~ 64%), MJO (~ 68%), QBWO (~ 64%) and ER (~ 65%)
    waves. These suggest that SSW is critical for many TCG events, and all of these
    intra-seasonal waves significantly modulate TCG events. A majority of TCs (~ 79%)
    were found to be related to more than one wave type, indicating an important role
    for a combination of dynamic and thermodynamic conditions associated with multiple
    waves in TCG events. Further analyses show that SSW activity is strongly modulated
    by the MJO and ER waves, while the QBWO has no significant impact on SSWs. During
    convectively active MJO and ER phases, stronger SSW trains with more distinct
    southeast-northwestward aligned structures can be found compared to convectively
    inactive phases. Similar intra-seasonal modulation of the transition from the
    mixed Rossby-gravity waves from the equatorial central Pacific to the SSW trains
    over the WNP by the three waves is noted, with such transitions largely favored
    during convectively active MJO and ER phases.

  keypoint1: Since the late 1990s, tropical cloud clusters have increased over the
    western North Pacific, especially over the eastern portion of the western North
    Pacific, but the frequency of TCs had decreased.
  keypoint2: There has been a decrease in genesis productivity, which was shown to
    be primarily due to increases in vertical wind shear in the eastern part of the
    western North Pacific.
  keypoint3: Since the late 1990s, the monsoon circulation in the western North Pacific
    has also weakened, shifting the upper-tropospheric trough farther west and increasing
    shear in the eastern part of the western North Pacific.
  abstract: Tropical cloud clusters (TCCs) play a critical role in sustaining tropical
    large-scale systems and are traditionally viewed as precursors for tropical cyclone
    (TC) genesis. This study focuses on the decadal changes in genesis productivity
    (GP), e.g. the efficiency of TCCs developing into TCs, and shows a significant
    decrease in GP over the western North Pacific (WNP) basin since 1998, when a climate
    regime change occurred. The significant decrease in TC frequency and the significant
    increase in TCCs, especially over the eastern region of the WNP basin, have combined
    to result in a reduced GP since 1998. These changes are dependent on the combined
    changes in large-scale atmospheric-oceanic conditions over the WNP basin. A decadal
    change in vertical wind shear, especially over the eastern portion of the WNP
    basin, appears to be the most important contributor to the recent decrease in
    GP. Increased vertical wind shear suppresses TC genesis but enhances the frequency
    of TCCs. Secondary positive contributions to the recent decrease in GP are from
    local sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and low-level relative vorticity. These
    positive contributions to the recent decrease in GP are partly cancelled out by
    a negative contribution from enhanced mid-relative moisture. Changes in these
    large-scale conditions associated with the recent decrease in GP over the WNP
    basin since 1998 are closely related to the weakening monsoon circulation and
    the westward shift of the tropical upper-tropospheric trough over the WNP. This
    is likely related to the changes observed in tropical SST anomalies around the
    globe.
