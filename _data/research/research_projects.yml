  title: Impacts of convective and stratiform processes on tropical cyclone intensity change
  grant: NSF CAREER
  description: This study is investigating convective and stratiform processes in TC intensification through analysis of mesoscale observations, with a focus on aircraft and Doppler radar data. Recent studies have suggested that the radial location of deep convective bursts and stratiform precipitation relative to the RMW may play an important role in intensification efficiency. Testing new hypotheses using observations is needed to diagnose the physical processes responsible for TC intensity change and forecasts.

  title: Multiscale Interactions in Tropical Cyclone Structure and Intensity Change
  grant: ONR PECASE
  description: The proposed research will improve our understanding of the multiscale interactions that result in TC genesis, rapid intensification, and weakening through an analysis of field observations collected during the Tropical Cyclone Intensity 2015 (TCI-2015) and Propagation of Intra-Seasonal Oscillations (PISTON) field projects in conjunction with numerical modeling. A better understanding of multiscale processes will enable improved environmental predictive capabilities for tactical planning and decision making.

  title: Lidar Radar Open Software Environment
  grant: NSF LROSE
  description: Radars and lidars are critical for protecting society from high impact weather and understanding the atmosphere and biosphere, but they are complex instruments that produce copious quantities of data that pose many challenges for researchers. This project will develop a new set of tools called the LROSE to meet these challenges and help address the ’big data’ problem faced by users in the research and education communities.

  title: Prediction of Rainfall Extremes Campaign In the Pacific
  grant: NSF PRECIP
  description: Extreme rainfall is a high impact weather phenomenon that profoundly affects people around the world, but our fundamental understanding and quantitative forecast skill for these events remains limited. To address these important scientific and forecast challenges, PRECIP in summer 2021 over Taiwan will be conducted to improve our understanding of the multi-scale dynamic, thermodynamic, and microphysical processes that produce extreme precipitation.

  title: Heating, Cooling, and Rapid Intensity Change in Tropical Cyclones
  grant: ONR TCRI
  description: The central objectives of this research are to improve our understanding of diabatic heating and cooling during TC rapid intensification (RI). The proposed research will accomplish these objectives through an analysis of field observations in conjunction with high-resolution numerical modeling. The central hypothesis of this research is that RI is caused by high efficiency diabatic heating and associated potential vorticity generation that requires cooperation across multiple spatial and temporal scales.

  title: Improvement of sub-seasonal to seasonal Atlantic basin hurricane forecasts
  grant: TC forecasting
  description: CSU has been issuing seasonal Atlantic hurricane forecasts since 1984. These forecasts have evolved in the 35+ years and now include sub-seasonal (e.g., two-week) forecasts issued during the peak months of the Atlantic hurricane season. While these forecasts have shown skill when issued in real time, there remains significant room for improvement.  Current research involves a better understanding of the drivers of sub-seasonal to seasonal variability driving Atlantic hurricane activity, with a focus on vertical wind shear.
