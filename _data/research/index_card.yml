  title: How does C<sub>D</sub> influence TC intensification?
  image: ../Research/img/Ellie_TC_schematic_art.png
  description: We developed a new, simplified conceptual model that relates TC boundary layer structural quantities---the maximum tangential wind, its radius, its height, its underlying vertical gradient, and its underlying drag coefficient---to the TC’s potential for further intensification. In addition, the new conceptual model is also able to be inverted and be used to retrieve values of interest, namely the drag coefficient under the maximum tangential wind.

  title: Are the asymmetric dynamics of Hurricane Michael (2018) polygonal eyewall consistent with vortex Rossby wave (VRW) theory?
  image: ../Research/img/cha_michael_grl2.png
  description: While polygonal eyewall shapes have been seen in previous hurricanes, the corresponding evolution of wind asymmetries has never been quantitatively deduced due to limitations from previous observations. Here we show the first observational evidence of the evolving wind field of a polygonal eyewall during RI to Category 5 intensity by deducing the winds at 5-minute intervals from single-Doppler Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) observations. The single Doppler radar analysis shows that the propagation speeds of different VRWs are consistent with linear wave theory.

  title: Why was the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season more active than anticipated and
    how we can better characterize uncertainty in seasonal hurricane forecasts?
  image: /Publications/figures/saunders_et_al_2020_Fig3.jpg
  description: Our group at CSU collaborated with Tropical Storm Risk, based at the
    University College-London, to investigate the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season in
    detail. We noted that the season was more active than was anticipated by seasonal
    forecasts issued prior to the peak of the season (e.g., before mid-August).  The
    season was also more active than would be anticipated given long-term historical
    relationships between large-scale conditions known to impact Atlantic hurricanes
    during the peak of the season (August-September) and Atlantic hurricanes.  The
    season ended up above-average for most TC parameters, despite above-normal tropical
    Atlantic vertical wind shear, below-normal tropical Atlantic SSTs and borderline
    weak El Niño conditions - all of which generally lead to below-average Atlantic
    hurricane activity.  Much of the activity in 2018 occurred at higher latitudes,
    where Atlantic seasonal TC forecasts generally have little (if any) predictability.  Our
    study argues that probabilistic methods be used to issue Atlantic seasonal forecasts
    in future years, in order to better account for these types of outlier seasons.

  title: How has the relationship between the Madden-Julian oscillation and Quasi-Biennial
    oscillation changed going back in time?
  image: ../Publications/figures/klotzbach_et_al_2019_scirep_Fig2.jpg
  description: Klotzbach et al. (2019) examined the relationship between the quasi-biennial
    oscillation (QBO) and the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) using long-term reconstructed
    indices.  There have been several studies noting a strong relationship between
    boreal winter QBO phase and MJO amplitude since the late 1970s, with an east phase
    of the QBO associated with higher MJO amplitude.  This study finds that the relationship
    has only become strong since the late 1970s, with no significant relationship
    between QBO phase and MJO amplitude prior to that time.  While there is increased
    uncertainty going back in time with both QBO and MJO indices, there is relatively
    high confidence in these indices at least since the late 1950s.  This study argues
    that changes in static stability associated with a cooling lower stratosphere
    and warming upper troposphere (likely caused by climate change) may have sensitized
    the region near the tropopause to QBO-induced changes in stability profiles.

  title: How do maximum sustained wind and minimum sea level pressure relate to normalized
    damage?
  image: ../Publications/figures/klotzbach_et_al_2020_bams_Fig1.jpg
  description: Atlantic hurricanes have historically been categorized using the Saffir-Simpson
    Hurricane Wind Scale, which ranks hurricanes based on their maximum sustained
    wind (e.g., V<sub>max</sub>).  In this study, we investigate whether V<sub>max</sub>
    or minimum sea level pressure (MSLP) historically has worked as a better predictor
    of continental US hurricane landfall damage.  We use the normalized hurricane
    damage dataset from Weinkle et al. (2018) and show that MSLP (r = 0.77) has a
    more significant correlation with damage than has V<sub>max</sub> (r = 0.66) for
    165 continental US landfalling hurricane events since 1900 (Figure 7).  The relationship
    has been much stronger for MSLP in recent years, where recent hurricanes like
    Ike (2008) and Sandy (2012) have done much more damage than would have been expected
    from their Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ranking.  MSLP has also been a
    much better predictor of damage for hurricanes making landfall from Georgia to
    Maine, where hurricanes tend to be larger and more sprawling.

  title: A Comparison of the Polarimetric Radar Characteristics of Heavy Rainfall
    From Hurricanes Harvey (2017) and Florence (2018)
  image: ../Research/img/DeHart_Bell_JGR_2020_Fig9.jpg
  description: Polarimetric coastal radar data are used to compare the rainfall characteristics
    of Hurricanes Harvey (2017) and Florence (2018). Intense rainfall was an infrequent
    yet important contributor to the total rainfall in Harvey, but its relative contribution
    varied spatially. The total rainfall over land maximized near the coast over Beaumont,
    TX due to intense convection resulting from prolonged onshore flow downshear from
    the circulation center. Overall, polarimetric radar observations in Harvey show
    a dominance of high concentrations of small-to-medium drops, consistent with prior
    tropical cyclone studies. The microphysical characteristics were spatially and
    temporally inhomogeneous however, with larger drops more frequent on 27 August
    and higher number concentrations more frequent on 28 and 30 August. The polarimetric
    variables and raindrop characteristics observed during Florence share broad similarities
    to Harvey, but had reduced variability, fewer observations of stronger reflectivity
    and differential reflectivity, and a lower frequency of high number concentrations
    and medium-sized drops. The radar data indicate Florence had reduced coverage
    of stronger convection compared to Harvey. We hypothesize that differences in
    storm motion, intensity decay rates, and vertical wind shear produce the distinct
    precipitation structures and microphysical differences seen in Harvey and Florence.

  title: How the wave pouch and vertical wind shear interactions play important roles in cyclongenesis in multi-scales?
  image: ../Research/img/nam_Hagupit_indexcard.png
  description: >
    Tropical cyclogenesis of pre-depression Hagupit was delayed while it interacted with upper-level trough, experiencing strong VWS.
    For the downscale cascade from the synoptic to meso-alpha scale, our analysis showed that pre-depression Hagupit was significantly affected by the strong northwesterly vertical wind shear.
    However, Hagupit survived through the hostile, strongly sheared environment, and eventually developed into a tropical cyclone after it escaped from the influence of upper-level trough.
    The upscale cascade from the persistent deep convection and its vorticity amplification through vortex tube stretching was a key process that enabled the pouch to persist even under 20 m/s VWS.
    We highlight the roles of localized low-level shear and cumulus congestus clouds inside the wave pouch as the localized vertical vorticity generated from the convective cells is aggregated through a vortex merger process inside the marsupial pouch.

  title: The Unconventional Eyewall Replacement Cycle of Hurricane Ophelia (2005)
  image: ../Research/img/Ophelia_index.png
  description: Using flight-level and airborne radar data, Hurricane Ophelia was shown to have undergone an unconventional eyewall replacement cycle (ERC). Ophelia\'s ERC was unconventional because it occurred while the storm was at Category \1 intensity and located over anomalously cold sea surface temperatures. Airborne radar analyses showed that the expansion of Ophelia\'s wind field associated with the ERC occurred in the dominantly stratiform rainbands, indicating that the stratiform kinematics in Ophelia's rainbands played a dominant role in Ophelia's ERC.

  title: How do the asymmetric processes impact Hurricane Matthew's (2016) Eyewall replacement cycle?
  image: ../Research/img/cha_matthew.png
  description: Hurricane Matthew was observed by the NEXRAD KAMX, KMLB, and KJAX polarimetric radars and NOAA P-3 airborne radar when it approached the southeastern United States during an ERC event. The radar observations indicate that Matthew's primary eyewall was replaced with a weaker outer eyewall, but unlike a classic ERC, Matthew did not reintensify after the inner eyewall disappeared. The single-Doppler analyses indicate that the inner eyewall decayed a few hours after the P-3 flight, while the outer eyewall contracted but did not reintensify and the asymmetries increased episodically. The analysis suggests that the resilient outer eyewall was influenced by both environmental vertical wind shear and an internal vortex Rossby wave damping mechanism during the ERC evolution.

  title: What separates developing and nondeveloping disturbances?
  image: ../Research/img/nam_Bifurcation_indexcard.png
  description: >
    To be, or not to be, that is the question of tropical cyclogenesis. Only about 15-20 % of African Easterly Waves develop into tropical cyclones (TCs).
    A WRF ensemble was created with multiple TC simulations spanning the relevant parameter space for three variables; 1) the VWS magnitude, 2) the environmental humidity, and 3) the initial vortex intensity.
    Unmeasurable random perturbations result in widely diverging scenarios in TC genesis in moderately sheared and dry environments.
    Here we hypothesize that the combination of moderate shear and dry air makes an unstable condition for a vortex to intensify or decay, which implifies that TC genesis in such environments may be intrinsically unpredictable in deterministic sense.
    We are currently looking at the link between the deep convection and the realignment of mid-level and low-level vortices comparing the developing and non-developing ensemble members.

  title: On the contributions of incipient vortex circulation and environmental moisture to tropical cyclone expansion
  image: ../Research/img/Martinez_etal_2020JGR_Figure7.png
  description: >
    Idealized numerical simulations of tropical cyclones are created to investigate the relative contributions of incipient vortex circulation and environmental moisture to tropical cyclone expansion. The principal findings demonstrate that an initially large vortex can expand more quickly than its relatively smaller counterpart. Increasing the environmental moisture further promotes expansion but mostly expedites the intensification process. Differences in the amount and scale of outer-core convection are associated with varying the incipient vortex circulation, resulting in variable expansion rates.

  title: What is the most decisive factors for Typhoon Risk in South Korea and how will that change with climate chage?
  image: ../Research/img/nam_risk_indexcard.png
  description: >
    In tropical cyclone (TC) risk assessment, many of previous studies have attempted to construct the statistical relationship of TC damage and TC intensity.
    This study shows that, in a decision tree analysis for TCs that made landfall in South Korea during 1979–2014, impact angle and extratropical transition (ET) are the most important factors to decide whether the TC risk to be activated as a catastrophe or to stay in the potential status.
    Our findings reaffirm that risk communication should focus more on the local hazards that residents in different areas actually experience (e.g. rainfall) rather than one representative intensify (e.g. central wind intensity) that is concentrated on the inner-core of a TC.
    We are currently collaborating with Dr. Doo-Sun R. Park (https://sites.google.com/view/dsrpark/) to examine how the TC risk, in particular heavy rainfall caused by TCs, would change with global warming.
