  title: How does C<sub>D</sub> influence TC intensification?
  image: ../Research/img/Ellie_TC_schematic_art.png
  description: We developed a new, simplified conceptual model that relates TC boundary layer structural quantities---the maximum tangential wind, its radius, its height, its underlying vertical gradient, and its underlying drag coefficient---to the TC’s potential for further intensification. In addition, the new conceptual model is also able to be inverted and be used to retrieve values of interest, namely the drag coefficient under the maximum tangential wind.

  title: Are the asymmetric dynamics of Hurricane Michael (2018) polygonal eyewall consistent with vortex Rossby wave (VRW) theory?
  image: ../Research/img/cha_michael_grl2.png
  description: While polygonal eyewall shapes have been seen in previous hurricanes, the corresponding evolution of wind asymmetries has never been quantitatively deduced due to limitations from previous observations. Here we show the first observational evidence of the evolving wind field of a polygonal eyewall during RI to Category 5 intensity by deducing the winds at 5-minute intervals from single-Doppler Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) observations. The single Doppler radar analysis shows that the propagation speeds of different VRWs are consistent with linear wave theory.

  title: Why was the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season more active than anticipated and
    how we can better characterize uncertainty in seasonal hurricane forecasts?
  image: /Publications/figures/saunders_et_al_2020_Fig3.jpg
  description: Our group at CSU collaborated with Tropical Storm Risk, based at the
    University College-London, to investigate the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season in
    detail. We noted that the season was more active than was anticipated by seasonal
    forecasts issued prior to the peak of the season (e.g., before mid-August).  The
    season was also more active than would be anticipated given long-term historical
    relationships between large-scale conditions known to impact Atlantic hurricanes
    during the peak of the season (August-September) and Atlantic hurricanes.  The
    season ended up above-average for most TC parameters, despite above-normal tropical
    Atlantic vertical wind shear, below-normal tropical Atlantic SSTs and borderline
    weak El Niño conditions - all of which generally lead to below-average Atlantic
    hurricane activity.  Much of the activity in 2018 occurred at higher latitudes,
    where Atlantic seasonal TC forecasts generally have little (if any) predictability.  Our
    study argues that probabilistic methods be used to issue Atlantic seasonal forecasts
    in future years, in order to better account for these types of outlier seasons.

  title: How has the relationship between the Madden-Julian oscillation and Quasi-Biennial
    oscillation changed going back in time?
  image: ../Publications/figures/klotzbach_et_al_2019_scirep_Fig2.jpg
  description: Klotzbach et al. (2019) examined the relationship between the quasi-biennial
    oscillation (QBO) and the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) using long-term reconstructed
    indices.  There have been several studies noting a strong relationship between
    boreal winter QBO phase and MJO amplitude since the late 1970s, with an east phase
    of the QBO associated with higher MJO amplitude.  This study finds that the relationship
    has only become strong since the late 1970s, with no significant relationship
    between QBO phase and MJO amplitude prior to that time.  While there is increased
    uncertainty going back in time with both QBO and MJO indices, there is relatively
    high confidence in these indices at least since the late 1950s.  This study argues
    that changes in static stability associated with a cooling lower stratosphere
    and warming upper troposphere (likely caused by climate change) may have sensitized
    the region near the tropopause to QBO-induced changes in stability profiles.

  title: How do maximum sustained wind and minimum sea level pressure relate to normalized
    damage?
  image: ../Publications/figures/klotzbach_et_al_2020_bams_Fig1.jpg
  description: Atlantic hurricanes have historically been categorized using the Saffir-Simpson
    Hurricane Wind Scale, which ranks hurricanes based on their maximum sustained
    wind (e.g., V<sub>max</sub>).  In this study, we investigate whether V<sub>max</sub>
    or minimum sea level pressure (MSLP) historically has worked as a better predictor
    of continental US hurricane landfall damage.  We use the normalized hurricane
    damage dataset from Weinkle et al. (2018) and show that MSLP (r = 0.77) has a
    more significant correlation with damage than has V<sub>max</sub> (r = 0.66) for
    165 continental US landfalling hurricane events since 1900 (Figure 7).  The relationship
    has been much stronger for MSLP in recent years, where recent hurricanes like
    Ike (2008) and Sandy (2012) have done much more damage than would have been expected
    from their Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale ranking.  MSLP has also been a
    much better predictor of damage for hurricanes making landfall from Georgia to
    Maine, where hurricanes tend to be larger and more sprawling.
