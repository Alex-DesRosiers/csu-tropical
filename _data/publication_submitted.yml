  keypoint1: This study examines the interactions of a pre-depression Hagupit with
    vertical wind shear (VWS) at various spatial scales from synoptic to meso-scales
    using field observations.
  keypoint2: We highlight the persistent convection maintaining moisture and vorticity
    inside the wave pouch even under 20 m/s deep-layer VWS.
  keypoint3: Our interpretation of the radar and dropsonde analyses provides a new
    insight for the supporting role of low-level VWS providing horizontal vorticity
    and organizing convection in the early stage of tropical cyclogenesis.

    The impact of vertical wind shear (VWS) on cyclogenesis is examined from the synoptic
    to meso scales using airborne Doppler radar observations of pre-depression Hagupit
    during Tropical Cyclone Structure 2008 (TCS08) / THORPEX Pacific Area Regional
    Campaign (T-PARC) field campaigns. The high temporal and spatial resolution observations
    reveal complex localized convective and vortical characteristics of a pre-depression
    in a sheared environment. Pre-depression Hagupit interacted with an upper-tropospheric
    trough during the observation period. The strong deep-layer VWS (> 20 m s -1)
    had a negative impact on the development through misalignment of the low and mid-level
    circulations and dry air intrusion. However, the low-level circulation persisted
    and the system ultimately formed into a tropical cyclone after it left the high-shear
    zone. Here we propose that a key process that enabled the predepression to survive
    through the upper-tropospheric trough interaction was persistent vorticity amplification
    on the meso-gamma scale that was aggregated on the mesoalpha scale within the
    pouch. Multi-Doppler wind analysis indicates that cumulus congestus tilted the
    low-level horizontal vorticity into the vertical in the early stage of convective
    life-cycle, followed by stretching from maturing deep convection. Variations in
    low-level VWS on the meso-beta scale affect convective organization and horizontal
    vorticity generation. The results provide new insights into multi-scale processes
    during TC genesis and the interactions of a pre-depression with VWS at various
    spatial scales.

  caption: "FIG. 13. Schematics of the multi-scale interactions in Hagupit’s cyclogenesis.
    a) Synoptic scale’s active features are upper-level trough and easterly waves,
    which carry the marsupial wave pouch shown as red circulation. b) Inside the meso-a
    scale wave pouch, shown are the low-level cyclonic stream lines with its center
    marked with black cross and mid-level center as yellow cross. Over the clouds
    shifted to southwest from the low-level center is vorticity (positive - red, negative
    - blue), showing vorticity dipoles from tilting, enhanced bigger vortex from stretching,
    and mid-level MCV over the stratiform area. c) In the meso-b scale S box (Fig.
    7b), the squall-like NW-SE convection can be explained by the local wind shear
    profile consist of winds from cyclonic circulation inside pouch, marsupial wave
    propagation, and the trough. Thick black lines in the lowerleft corner of the
    circle indicates convective line; L indicates ENE low-level shear; M indicates
    WNW mid-level shear. d) Meso-g scale convective cells produce vorticity that serves
    as building block for the wave pouch intensification through tilting the horizontal
    shear (S cell) and stretching the existent vorticity (N cell)."
