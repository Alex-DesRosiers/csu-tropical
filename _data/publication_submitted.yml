  keypoint1: Single Doppler radar retrievals capture the structural evolution of Hurricane
    Michael's polygonal eyewall during rapid intensification. # It can be capsule summary or keypoint
  keypoint2: The propagation speeds of asymmetric winds and reflectivity are consistent
    with linear vortex Rossby wave theory.
  keypoint3: Coastal radar observations and the generalized velocity track display
    technique can help to improve tropical cyclone intensity forecasts.
  abstract: Hurricane Matthew (2016) was observed by the NEXRAD KAMX polarimetric
    radar and NOAA P-3 airborne radar near the coast of the southeastern United States
    for several hours, providing a novel opportunity to evaluate and compare single
    and multiple Doppler wind retrieval techniques for tropical cyclone flows. The
    generalized velocity track display (GVTD) technique can retrieve a subset of the
    wind field from a single ground-based Doppler radar under the assumption of nearly
    axisymmetric rotational wind, but is shown to have errors from aliasing of unresolved
    wind components. An improved technique that mitigates errors due to storm motion
    is derived in this study, although some spatial aliasing remains due to limited
    information content from the single Doppler measurements. A spline-based variational
    wind retrieval technique called SAMURAI can retrieve the full three-dimensional
    wind field from airborne radar fore-aft pseudo-dual Doppler scanning, but is shown
    to have errors due to temporal aliasing from the non-simultaneous Doppler measurements.
    A comparison between the two techniques shows that the axisymmetric tangential
    winds are generally comparable between the two techniques after the improvements
    to GVTD retrievals. Fourier decomposition of asymmetric kinematic and convective
    structure shows more discrepancies due to spatial and temporal aliasing in the
    retrievals. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique for studying tropical
    cyclone structure are discussed, and suggest that complementary information can
    be retrieved from both single and multiple Doppler retrievals. Future improvements
    to the asymmetric flow assumptions in single Doppler analysis and steady-state
    assumptions in pseudo-dual Doppler analysis are required to reconcile differences
    in retrieved tropical cyclone structure.
  summary: Polygonal eyewall asymmetries of Hurricane Michael (2018) during rapid
    intensification (RI) are analyzed from ground-based single Doppler radar. Here
    we present the first observational evidence of the evolving wind field of a polygonal
    eyewall during RI to Category 5 intensity by deducing the axisymmetric and asymmetric
    winds at 5-minute intervals. Spectral time decomposition of the retrieved tangential
    wind structure shows quantitative evidence of high-order azimuthal wavenumbers
    with propagation speeds that are consistent with linear wave theory on a radial
    vorticity gradient, suggesting the presence of rapidly-evolving vortex Rossby
    waves. Dual-Doppler winds from the airborne NOAA P-3 Hurricane Hunter provide
    further evidence of the three-dimensional vortex structure that supports growth
    of asymmetries during RI. Both reflectivity and tangential wind fields show polygonal
    structure and propagate at similar speeds, suggesting a close coupling of the
    dynamics and the convective organization during the intensification.

  keypoint1: This study examines the interactions of a pre-depression Hagupit with
    vertical wind shear (VWS) at various spatial scales from synoptic to meso-scales
    using field observations.
  keypoint2: We highlight the persistent convection maintaining moisture and vorticity
    inside the wave pouch even under 20 m/s deep-layer VWS.
  keypoint3: Our interpretation of the radar and dropsonde analyses provides a new
    insight for the supporting role of low-level VWS providing horizontal vorticity
    and organizing convection in the early stage of tropical cyclogenesis.
  abstract: >
    The impact of vertical wind shear (VWS) on cyclogenesis is examined from the synoptic
    to meso scales using airborne Doppler radar observations of pre-depression Hagupit
    during Tropical Cyclone Structure 2008 (TCS08) / THORPEX Pacific Area Regional
    Campaign (T-PARC) field campaigns. The high temporal and spatial resolution observations
    reveal complex localized convective and vortical characteristics of a pre-depression
    in a sheared environment. Pre-depression Hagupit interacted with an upper-tropospheric
    trough during the observation period. The strong deep-layer VWS (> 20 m s -1)
    had a negative impact on the development through misalignment of the low and mid-level
    circulations and dry air intrusion. However, the low-level circulation persisted
    and the system ultimately formed into a tropical cyclone after it left the high-shear
    zone. Here we propose that a key process that enabled the predepression to survive
    through the upper-tropospheric trough interaction was persistent vorticity amplification
    on the meso-gamma scale that was aggregated on the mesoalpha scale within the
    pouch. Multi-Doppler wind analysis indicates that cumulus congestus tilted the
    low-level horizontal vorticity into the vertical in the early stage of convective
    life-cycle, followed by stretching from maturing deep convection. Variations in
    low-level VWS on the meso-beta scale affect convective organization and horizontal
    vorticity generation. The results provide new insights into multi-scale processes
    during TC genesis and the interactions of a pre-depression with VWS at various
    spatial scales.

  caption: "FIG. 13. Schematics of the multi-scale interactions in Hagupit’s cyclogenesis.
    a) Synoptic scale’s active features are upper-level trough and easterly waves,
    which carry the marsupial wave pouch shown as red circulation. b) Inside the meso-a
    scale wave pouch, shown are the low-level cyclonic stream lines with its center
    marked with black cross and mid-level center as yellow cross. Over the clouds
    shifted to southwest from the low-level center is vorticity (positive - red, negative
    - blue), showing vorticity dipoles from tilting, enhanced bigger vortex from stretching,
    and mid-level MCV over the stratiform area. c) In the meso-b scale S box (Fig.
    7b), the squall-like NW-SE convection can be explained by the local wind shear
    profile consist of winds from cyclonic circulation inside pouch, marsupial wave
    propagation, and the trough. Thick black lines in the lowerleft corner of the
    circle indicates convective line; L indicates ENE low-level shear; M indicates
    WNW mid-level shear. d) Meso-g scale convective cells produce vorticity that serves
    as building block for the wave pouch intensification through tilting the horizontal
    shear (S cell) and stretching the existent vorticity (N cell)."
