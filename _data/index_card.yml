  title: How does C<sub>D</sub> influence TC intensification?
  image: ../Research/img/Ellie_TC_schematic_art.png
  description: We developed a new, simplified conceptual model that relates TC boundary layer structural quantities---the maximum tangential wind, its radius, its height, its underlying vertical gradient, and its underlying drag coefficient---to the TCâ€™s potential for further intensification. In addition, the new conceptual model is also able to be inverted and be used to retrieve values of interest, namely the drag coefficient under the maximum tangential wind.

  title: What are the convective and kinematic structure of Hurricane Michael's polygonal eyewall during its rapid intensification?
  image: ./Research/img/cha_michael_grl2.png
  description: While polygonal eyewall shapes have been seen in previous hurricanes, the corresponding evolution of wind asymmetries has never been quantitatively deduced due to limitations from previous observations. Here we show the first observational evidence of the evolving wind field of a polygonal eyewall during RI to Category 5 intensity by deducing the winds at 5-minute intervals from single-Doppler Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) observations.
