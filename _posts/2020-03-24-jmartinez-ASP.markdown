After defending his Ph.D. in May, Jon Martinez will continue his tropical cyclone research thanks to an Advanced Study Program postdoctoral fellowship from the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

“This is a very selective program, and this honor is a testament to all of Jon’s hard work during his Ph.D.,” said Associate Professor Michael Bell, Martinez’s adviser.

Martinez will investigate how tropical cyclone frequency might change in Earth’s warming climate system by analyzing variability in the processes that contribute to tropical cyclone formation. Beginning in mid-August, his research project will be based at the Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology Laboratory, but he plans to collaborate with scientists from other NCAR labs as well.

“I’m sincerely honored to be selected as an ASP postdoctoral fellow and look forward to collaborating with NCAR scientists in bridging weather extremes and climate change research,” Martinez said.

Martinez hopes his research ultimately will inform risk projections of landfalling tropical cyclones among increasingly vulnerable coastal communities.
