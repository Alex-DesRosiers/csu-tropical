Chelsea Nam is a PhD candidate studying convective structure and evolution during tropical cyclone genesis. To better understand the complex, multi-scale tropical cyclogenesis, she uses a number of different datasets and methods including radar (airborne, shipborne) data, ensemble high-resolution mesoscale models (WRF and CM1) and large-scale reanalyses. She started her PhD at Colorado State University (CSU) in 2017 after She received a B.S in earth science from Seoul National University (SNU) at South Korea in 2015, and her M.S in atmospheric science from SNU in 2017. During her Masterâ€™s, she researched TC risk in statistical and climatological perspective working with Dr. Chang-Hoi Ho and Dr. Doo-Sun R. Park. She has a passion for teaching; she was an instructor for the undergraduate Intro course for atmospheric science at CSU in 2019 and she served as a teaching assistant for Atmospheric Dynamics II course in 2020.
