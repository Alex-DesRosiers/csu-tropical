Chandra Pasillas is a Ph. D. candidate co-advised by Michael Bell and Christian Kummerow. She is working to advance geostationary nighttime multi-spectral imaging for low cloud detection with applications towards improving fog forecasting and tropical cyclone forecasting through the use of derived motion winds.Chandra received her Bachelors’ of Science in Meteorology from the United States Air Force Academy in 2004, and then entered the United States Air Force (USAF) as a weather officer. She obtained her Masters’ of Science in Atmosphere Science from the Naval Post-graduate School where she studied the impacts of time latency and satellite selection to the USAF’s World Wide Merged Cloud Analysis (WWMCA) product under Dr. Tom Murphree. In addition to her current research, Chandra is interested in bringing research products into operations capacity to provide today’s forecasters with the best tools available for informing leaders and aviators of adverse weather impacts.
