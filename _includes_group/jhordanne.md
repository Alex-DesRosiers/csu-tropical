Jhordanne is a PhD candidate studying the relationships between the large-scale tropical environment and tropical cyclone activity with a focus on improving subseasonal to seasonal forecast prediction. Another part of her research includes studying ways in which the combination of global climate model output and machine learning can be used to improve prediction skill. Jhordanne received her MPhil./MSc. in Applied Physics (Climate Physics) in 2016 from the University of the West Indies in Kingston, Jamaica. For her Masterâ€™s thesis, she studied changes in North Atlantic tropical cyclone frequency by operational statistical forecast schemes in a warmed climate. In future work, Jhordanne hopes to further explore hurricane activity in climate model environments and examine how much predictability (and future projection) can be gained from them.
